# Sherman's Shell Style CV Generator!

You should hire me, I like making things, even if they are a bit silly.

How else better to back up the claim that I spend a lot of my time looking and
typing in to a terminal than to present my CV in the same style, using some of
the tools that I use day to day? 

## How to use

Feel free to grab this repo and make your own CV in this style. 
The make script included with do some useful things:

    $ make 

Will run the `show_cv.sh` script, created a latest and archive version

    $ make clean

Will remove everything in archive and the latest version

## TODO

:white_medium_square: Making the tree timeline is too much effort to do manually
