$ echo $STATEMENT
Programmer and system administrator. Enjoys creating programs, services and 
infrastructure for them to run on. After 4 years of Sysadmin work for an ISP, 
mostly working on customers Linux systems and networking issues, I am looking
for a programming opportunity driven by agile, TTD, version control and 
CI practices. Happy to work on front-end or back-end code, API integration's or
devops style tasks that require a high level of automation.
